You can obtained the well pre-processed datasets from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Cg1KYOlzM5C7K8gK8NfC-F3EYxkM3D2?usp=sharing), [[Tsinghua Cloud]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/84fbc752d0e94980a610/) or [[Baidu Drive]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r3KhGd0Q9PJIUZdfEYoymg?pwd=i9iy). Then place the downloaded data under the folder `./dataset`. Here is a summary of supported datasets.


3. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:
